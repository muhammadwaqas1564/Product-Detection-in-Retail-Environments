# Product-Detection-in-Retail-Environments

Overview
  This project focuses on developing an automated product detection system for retail environments using YOLOv11 (You Only Look Once). The system enhances inventory management by accurately detecting and classifying products on retail shelves in real-time. By integrating advanced computer vision techniques, the solution aims to reduce stockouts, improve restocking efficiency, and minimize shrinkage due to theft or misplaced items

Features
  Real-time Product Detection: Identifies and classifies products on retail shelves.
  Automated Inventory Monitoring: Tracks product availability and organization.
  Restocking Optimization: Provides insights into low-stock items for efficient replenishment.
  Shrinkage Prevention: Helps reduce losses from theft or misplaced products.
  Seamless Integration: Can be integrated with existing retail inventory systems.

Technologies Used
  Deep Learning (YOLOv11 for object detection)
  Computer Vision
  Python
  Roboflow (for dataset annotation)
  Cloud/Edge Deployment (for real-time processing)

Dataset
  A custom Inventory Management System dataset was collected and annotated manually using Roboflow.
